# BERT_FINE-TUNING
 Fine-tuning BERT to classify hate and offensive language.

The dataset used for training consists of tweets labelled as hate, offensive or neither. 
You can find the dataset and trained model on my Hugging Face account:

- model: [MartynaKopyta/BERT_hate_offensive_tweets](https://huggingface.co/MartynaKopyta/BERT_hate_offensive_tweets)

The notebook provided is based on this one: https://mccormickml.com/2019/07/22/BERT-fine-tuning/ and a notebook provided in the youtube video mentioned at the beginning of the tutorial.
