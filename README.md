# BERT_FINE-TUNING
 Fine-tuning BERT to classify hate and offensive language.

The dataset used for training consists of tweets labelled as hate, offensive or neither. 
You can find the original dataset on kaggle: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/thedevastator/hate-speech-and-offensive-language-detection/data
but in the notebook I use a version of this dataset from Hugging Face that was split into training and test data: https://huggingface.co/datasets/SetFit/hate_speech_offensive.

The notebook provided is based on this one: https://mccormickml.com/2019/07/22/BERT-fine-tuning/ and a notebook provided in the youtube video mentioned at the beginning of the tutorial.
